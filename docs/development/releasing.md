# Commit Conventions & Releasing

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to drive automated
changelog generation and version bumps via
[`commit-and-tag-version`](https://github.com/absolute-version/commit-and-tag-version).

## Commit message format

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

<optional body>

<optional footer(s)>
```

Commit messages are validated by [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/)
(`@commitlint/config-conventional`) through the Husky `commit-msg` hook, so non-conforming messages
are rejected locally before they land.

### Types and how they map to the changelog

| Commit type                             | Changelog section | Version bump |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| `feat`                                  | **Added**         | minor        |
| `fix`                                   | **Fixed**         | patch        |
| `perf`                                  | **Changed**       | patch        |
| `refactor` / `revert`                   | **Changed**       | patch        |
| `docs`                                  | **Documentation** | patch\*      |
| `chore`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `style` | _(hidden)_        | none         |

\* On their own, `docs`/`perf`/etc. only bump the version when a release is cut; a release with only
hidden types produces no version change.

### Breaking changes

A breaking change triggers a **major** bump and appears under a dedicated **⚠ BREAKING CHANGES**
section. Signal it either way:

```
feat(repo)!: return { id } from update() instead of the full document
```

```
feat(repo): return { id } from update()

BREAKING CHANGE: update() no longer returns the full document; pass { returnDoc: true } for that.
```

### Examples

```
feat(vector): add distanceThreshold option to findNearest()
fix(query): normalize null aggregate result to 0
docs(readme): document the merge/patch limitation
refactor(validation): extract sentinel-path collection helper
chore(deps): bump firebase-tools to ^14.28.0
```

## Cutting a release

Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed, so a release is a **two-step** flow: bump the version on a
branch and merge it via PR, then publish a GitHub Release off `main`. Publishing to npm happens in
CI when a GitHub Release is published (see
[`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](../../.github/workflows/publish.yml)).

**Agent workflow:** follow the [`releasing` skill](../../.rulesync/skills/releasing/SKILL.md) —
always run `npm run release:bump:dry` and get explicit approval of the proposed version before
`npm run release:bump` writes anything.

### 1. Bump on a branch, then open a PR

```bash
git checkout -b release/x.y.z

# preview the next version + changelog without writing anything
npm run release:bump:dry

# bump version (from commits), regenerate CHANGELOG.md, and commit — does NOT tag
npm run release:bump

# override the bump if needed
npm run release:bump -- --release-as minor
npm run release:bump -- --release-as 2.2.0

# push the branch only — never push tags from the branch (see the warning below)
git push -u origin release/x.y.z
```

Open a PR for the branch and let CI run. `npm run release:bump` will:

1. Determine the next version from the commits since the last tag.
2. Prepend a new section to [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) (existing entries are preserved) and
   run Prettier over it.
3. Bump `version` in `package.json`.
4. Create a `chore(release): x.y.z` commit. It does **not** create a tag (`--skip.tag`).

### 2. Merge the PR, then publish the Release

Once the release PR is merged, create a GitHub Release targeting `main` — publishing the Release is
what triggers the npm publish:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
npm run release:publish
```

`release:publish` runs
`gh release create v$npm_package_version --target main --title v$npm_package_version --generate-notes`.
It creates the `vx.y.z` tag **on `main`'s current tip, resolved server-side** (via `--target main`)
plus a GitHub Release, which fires the publish workflow. Because the commit comes from `main` on the
remote, it doesn't matter which branch you have checked out — but the tag _name_ is read from your
local `package.json`, so pull `main` first (as above) or you'll label the release with a stale
version.

> **Tags no longer trigger publishing — only a published GitHub Release does.** A stray `git push`
> of a tag is therefore harmless, and you can create baseline/backfill tags freely (see below).
> `--generate-notes` fills the Release page from merged PRs; swap in `--notes-file` if you want it
> to mirror `CHANGELOG.md`.

The publish workflow then:

1. Installs dependencies on Node 24 (from `.nvmrc`, which ships npm ≥ 11.16 for OIDC Trusted
   Publishing and for `.npmrc` `min-release-age=2`) and JDK 21 (required for the Firestore emulator;
   `firebase-tools@15` drops Java < 21).
2. Runs `npm run test:coverage:all` — unit coverage + unit gate, then emulator integration
   coverage + integration gate (same dual gates as PR CI / local full check).
3. Builds the package and publishes to npm via
   [Trusted Publishing (OIDC)](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/) — no long-lived
   `NPM_TOKEN`.

### FlintFire first-package sequence (3.0.0) — completed 2026-08-23

`flintfire@3.0.0` is on npm (`latest`). Trusted Publishing (OIDC) cannot **create** a package, so
the first tarball was a **manual** publish. Dist-tag had to be explicit: a bare `npm publish` would
have claimed `latest` with an RC. This sequence is the historical bootstrap, not a recurring
procedure:

1. **RC1 (manual, `--tag next`).** After the repo was renamed to `reggieofarrell/flintfire` and
   Environment `npm` existed, from the RC1 commit: `npm publish --access public --tag next`. Never
   omit `--tag next` on a first-package RC.
2. **Trusted Publisher.** Once `flintfire` existed on the registry:
   ```bash
   npm trust github \
     --repository reggieofarrell/flintfire \
     --file publish.yml \
     --environment npm \
     --allow-publish
   ```
   Use `--file`, not `--workflow` (T19). Fields: repository `reggieofarrell/flintfire`, workflow
   file `publish.yml`, Environment `npm`.
3. **RC2 (OIDC proof).** GitHub prerelease `v3.0.0-rc.2` → `publish.yml` published `--tag next`
   after Environment `npm` approval. Provenance confirmed on the registry.
4. **Stable 3.0.0.** GitHub Release `v3.0.0` (not a prerelease) → `--tag latest`.
5. After OIDC was proven: **Publishing access** → require 2FA and **disallow tokens**.

Later FlintFire versions publish only through a GitHub Release + OIDC (`publish.yml`). Do not repeat
the manual bootstrap unless creating an unrelated new package name.

Recovery: if a workflow looks failed, `npm view flintfire versions --json` before retrying. npm
versions are immutable; a successful publish that GitHub marked failed must not be retried. A bad RC
advances to the next RC number. A bad stable is a later patch and/or deprecation, never an overwrite
of `3.0.0`.

## Dual README (GitHub vs npm)

GitHub and npmjs.org show **different** READMEs from the same repo:

| Audience                       | Source file                            | Surface                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Contributors / GitHub visitors | [`README.md`](../../README.md)         | GitHub repo home       |
| npm consumers                  | [`npm-readme.md`](../../npm-readme.md) | npmjs.org package page |

There is no `package.json` field for an alternate readme name — the registry always displays the
tarball’s root `README.md`. The consumer source is named `npm-readme.md` (not `README.npm.md`) so
npm’s always-include README-variant rules do not pack the source file twice. At pack/publish time:

1. **`prepack`** runs `node scripts/stage-npm-readme.mjs stage` — backs up the GitHub `README.md` to
   `.README.github.bak`, then copies `npm-readme.md` over `README.md`.
2. npm packs that staged `README.md` into the tarball.
3. **`postpack`** runs `node scripts/stage-npm-readme.mjs restore` — puts the GitHub README back.

Never commit the staged swap or `.README.github.bak` (gitignored). If a pack crashes mid-swap:

```bash
node scripts/stage-npm-readme.mjs restore
```

**Which file to edit**

- Consumer install / quick start / peer deps / docs links → both files; follow the
  [`readme-sync` skill](../../.cursor/skills/readme-sync/SKILL.md).
- Testing, contributing, ADRs, roadmap → `README.md` only.

`npm run check:package` stages/restores explicitly (it uses `--ignore-scripts`) and asserts the
packed README carries the npm-only marker.

### One-time baseline tag

The `2.0.0` entry in the changelog was written by hand and the repo has no `v2.0.0` tag yet. So the
first automated release computes its delta from **all** history. To make the first
`npm run release:bump` produce a clean delta instead, create the baseline tag once, on the commit
that shipped `2.0.0`:

```bash
git tag -a v2.0.0 <2.0.0-release-commit> -m "2.0.0"
git push origin v2.0.0
```

After that, every `npm run release:bump` diffs from the most recent `vx.y.z` tag.

> **Safe now:** because publishing is triggered only by a **published GitHub Release** (not by a tag
> push), you can push baseline or backfill tags — e.g. a missing `v2.1.0` on its `chore(release)`
> commit — without triggering an npm publish. Such tags only affect how the next
> `npm run release:bump` computes its changelog delta.

## Published declaration hygiene (`stripInternal`)

`tsconfig.json` sets `stripInternal: true`, so a declaration carrying the `@internal` JSDoc tag is
removed from the emitted `.d.ts`. If a **public** (untagged) exported type still _references_ that
name, the reference survives while the declaration it points at does not — and the published `.d.ts`
stops compiling.

**No gate leg catches this.** Measured while shipping ADR-0040 (issue #108): with two
`error TS2304: Cannot find name 'StagingTarget'` sitting in `dist/core/FirestoreRepository.d.ts`,
`npm run build`, `npm run test:types`, `npm run check:package` **and** `npm run check:consumer` were
all green. `check:consumer` misses it _by design_ — it compiles the packed consumer with
`skipLibCheck: true`
([`scripts/check-packed-consumer.mjs`](../../scripts/check-packed-consumer.mjs)), because a strict
pass would drown in `firebase-admin`'s transitive declarations. So a consumer compiling with
`skipLibCheck: false` breaks on install and nothing in CI warns first.

Compile the emitted declarations directly, after `npm run build`:

```bash
find dist -name '*.d.ts' -print0 |
  xargs -0 npx tsc --noEmit --strict --module nodenext --moduleResolution nodenext
```

Expected: exit 0, no output. `TS2304` — or `TS2305`, when another module re-exports the stripped
name — means a stripped declaration leaked into a public signature. Run it on any change that adds,
renames, or re-exports a public type, or that moves an `@internal` tag, and before cutting a
release.

Use `find`, not `dist/**/*.d.ts`. That glob is shell-dependent: zsh expands it recursively (48 files
here), while macOS `bash` has no `globstar` and quietly expands it one level deep (24 files) — then
exits 0 on a half-checked `dist`, which is the same silent-partial-pass this section exists to warn
about.

**Avoiding the trap.** Do not tag a type `@internal` merely to keep it off the public API: _not_
re-exporting it from `src/index.ts` already does that. Reserve the tag for members of
otherwise-public declarations, which is the case
[`scripts/check-package-contents.mjs`](../../scripts/check-package-contents.mjs)'s
declaration-hygiene guard already covers. Note also that TypeScript reads the tag out of a comment
**regardless of markup**, so merely mentioning it inside a code span in a `.ts` JSDoc block applies
it — #108 hit exactly that while writing the warning not to use it.

Recorded instances, so the shape is recognizable:

- `ReadOnlyQueryClauseKeys` — [ADR-0041](../adr/0041-read-only-query-builder-type.md) (issue #100).
  Stripping it silently re-opened `update` / `delete` on the published `ReadOnlyQuery`.
- The collection-group query types — [ADR-0024](../adr/0024-collection-group-queries.md), which
  records them as exported-but-not-re-exported for this reason.
- `StagingTarget` / `WriteGroup` — [ADR-0040](../adr/0040-repository-write-interceptors.md) (issue
  #108).

Worth turning into a real gate leg (a `check:declarations` script wired into CI and pre-publish)
rather than a remembered manual step; it is not one today.

## Configuration

- [`.versionrc.cjs`](../../.versionrc.cjs) — changelog section mapping, FlintFire commit/compare URL
  formats, the wrapping conventionalcommits preset (P14 note normalization), and the `postchangelog`
  Prettier hook.
- [`commitlint.config.js`](../../commitlint.config.js) — extends `@commitlint/config-conventional`.
- [`.husky/commit-msg`](../../.husky/commit-msg) — runs commitlint on each commit message.
- [`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](../../.github/workflows/publish.yml) — release-triggered npm
  publish: GitHub prereleases → npm tag `next`, stable releases → `latest`, Environment `npm`,
  coverage gates, and OIDC Trusted Publishing.
