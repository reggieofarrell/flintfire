# Testing Guide

This document describes how `flintfire` is tested, how to run suites locally, and conventions for
adding new tests.

## Design decisions

These choices are intentional for a **database library** — false confidence is worse than a lower
global percentage.

| Decision             | Choice                                             | Rationale                                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test runner          | **Jest** (not Vitest)                              | Matches existing suite, ts-jest ESM setup, Firebase emulator `exec` workflow           |
| Primary confidence   | **Integration** (emulator)                         | Real Firestore reads/writes, batching, indexes, hooks — what can wreck a database      |
| Secondary confidence | **Unit** (mocks)                                   | Fast feedback on pure logic, errors, validation, dot notation                          |
| Coverage gates       | **Dual, path-specific** per suite                  | Merged LCOV counts a line covered if _either_ suite hit it — overstates safety         |
| Gate enforcement     | `scripts/check-coverage-gates.mjs`                 | Jest `coverageThreshold` cannot express per-suite ownership of the same files          |
| Pre-push hook        | Secret scan + skippable Sonar precheck + unit gate | No Java/emulator required for everyday pushes; server scan skippable when unavailable  |
| CI                   | Parallel coverage jobs, then Casadega Sonar scan   | Dual gates plus a new-code-only SonarQube quality gate on PRs and `main`               |
| Type-level tests     | `*.type-test.ts` via `npm run test:types` (`tsc`)  | ts-jest runs `isolatedModules` (no type-checking); `tsc` verifies write-type contracts |
| Shared test infra    | Factories + mocks under `src/tests/shared/`        | No barrel re-exports; import specific modules                                          |
| File naming          | `*.unit.test.ts` / `*.integration.test.ts`         | Clear tier at a glance                                                                 |

## Test pyramid

```
  /  Integration (emulator)  \   Fewer — real Firestore reads/writes, Java required
 /____________________________\
/   Unit (Jest, Node, mocks)   \   More — fast, isolated logic
```

| Tier            | What it tests                                                                            | When to use                                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit**        | Pure utilities, validation, error mapping, mocked Firestore wiring                       | Logic that does not need emulator semantics                                     |
| **Integration** | Repository, QueryBuilder, hooks, transactions, sentinels (permissive + strict per-field) | Firestore behavior, batching, indexes, real writes — **primary ORM safety net** |

## Directory layout

```
src/tests/
├── unit/                    # Fast tests (no emulator)
├── integration/             # Emulator-backed tests

```

**Naming:** `{domain}.unit.test.ts` and `{domain}.integration.test.ts`.

### Local integration prerequisites

- Node.js 24 (see `.nvmrc`; CI and publish use the same pin)
- JDK 21+ (Firestore emulator; `firebase-tools@15` drops Java < 21)
- `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` defaults to `127.0.0.1:8080`

## Integration harness

Use
[firestoreIntegrationHarness.ts](../../src/tests/integration/helpers/firestoreIntegrationHarness.ts):

- `createUserRepoHarness(prefix)` — isolated collection per suite, `trackUser`, cleanup helpers
- `createValidatedRepo(db)` — schema-validated repo for sentinel/hook tests (default
  `sentinelPolicy: 'permissive'`)
- `createStrictRepo(db)` — `sentinelPolicy: 'strict'` repo built from the combinator-based
  `strictHookValidatedUserSchema`, for per-field sentinel-approval tests
- `cleanupValidatedRepo(repo)` — deletes all docs in a validated/strict repo's collection
- Unique collection names prevent cross-test interference

## Shared factories

Import from specific modules (no barrel files):

```typescript
import { createTestUserInput } from '../shared/factories/user.factory.js';
import { resetTestFactoryCounters } from '../shared/factories/counters.js';
```

Call `resetTestFactoryCounters()` in `beforeEach` when deterministic IDs matter.

## Unit test conventions

- Mock **at the Firestore boundary** using `createMockFirestoreDb()` from `src/tests/shared/mocks/`
- Mock factories hold **`jest.fn()` spies** — do not reimplement Firestore behavior inline
- Add a **JSDoc file header** stating strategy and what is verified

## Integration test conventions

- Use isolated collections via harness (never share collection names across suites)
- `afterEach`: `cleanupTrackedUsers()`
- `afterAll`: `cleanupCollection()` as safety net
- Prefer factories over inline object literals for create payloads

## Coverage policy

Merged LCOV reports are **not** used as the primary gate. Unit and integration suites are
complementary — a line hit in either suite would count as covered in a merged report, which
overstates confidence for a database library. Instead, each suite enforces **path-specific**
thresholds via `scripts/check-coverage-gates.mjs`.

### Unit gate (pre-push + CI)

| Scope                    | Files                                                 | Lines | Branches | Functions |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------- | --------- |
| Pure utilities           | `src/utils/**`                                        | 95%   | 90%      | 90%       |
| Error / validation layer | `Errors`, `ErrorParser`, `ErrorHandler`, `Validation` | 90%   | 85%      | 90%       |
| Package exports          | `src/index.ts`                                        | 100%  | 100%     | 65%       |

### Integration gate (CI)

| Scope                       | Files                    | Lines | Branches | Functions |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----- | -------- | --------- |
| ORM core                    | `FirestoreRepository.ts` | 90%   | 75%      | 85%       |
| Query layer                 | `QueryBuilder.ts`        | 90%   | 75%      | 95%       |
| Collection groups           | `CollectionGroup.ts`     | 90%   | 75%      | 95%       |
| Validation (emulator paths) | `Validation.ts`          | 90%   | 80%      | 95%       |
| Vector extension (emulator) | `src/vector/**`          | 90%   | 75%      | 90%       |

**Pre-push** runs a fail-closed outgoing secret scan, then `npm run sonar:precheck` (exit 2 skips
loudly when Scanner/credentials/server are unavailable), then `rules:check` + `test:types` +
`check:docs` + `check:zod-idioms` + `test:unit:coverage` + `test:coverage:gate:unit` (no
Java/emulator). See [sonarqube.md](./sonarqube.md).

**CI** runs each suite with coverage, then its gate, in parallel matrix jobs, plus a `Type checks`
job (`test:types`). After both coverage artifacts upload, the Tests workflow calls
[`Casadega-Development/action-workflows`](https://github.com/Casadega-Development/action-workflows)
to scan the PR head or `main`, wait on the official **new-code** quality gate, and (on pull
requests) upsert a sticky Sonar comment. Combined LCOV in Sonar is informational only.

**Local full check:** `npm run test:coverage:all`

### What we do not gate

- **Merged LCOV** — report-only if you merge manually (including the combined report SonarQube
  displays); never used as a CI/pre-push gate
- **Global suite percentages** — a 60% unit run is expected; only path-specific gates matter
- **FirestoreRepository / QueryBuilder / CollectionGroup on unit reports** — owned by integration
  gate
- **Utils / error layer on integration reports** — owned by unit gate

Thresholds live in `scripts/check-coverage-gates.mjs`. Update that file and this doc together when
ratcheting.

## Git hooks

| Hook           | Command                                                                                                                         | Purpose                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **pre-commit** | `sonar hook git-pre-commit` then `lint-staged`                                                                                  | Fail-closed secret scan, then ESLint (including sonarjs) + Prettier on staged files               |
| **pre-push**   | outgoing secret scan + `sonar:precheck` + `rules:check` + `test:types` + `check:docs` + `check:zod-idioms` + unit coverage gate | Secrets always block; changed-file Sonar skips only when unavailable; then the existing unit gate |

## Type-level tests

`src/tests/types/*.type-test.ts` files are checked by `npm run test:types`
(`tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.typecheck.json`), **not** by jest — the jest suites run ts-jest with
`isolatedModules`, which transpiles without type-checking, so `@ts-expect-error` and type
regressions are invisible to them. Type-test files are excluded from the build (`**/*.type-test.ts`
in `tsconfig.json`) and are never executed; each `@ts-expect-error` fails the type check if the line
below it stops being an error. Use them to pin compile-time contracts (e.g. the repository's
write-input types).

## Anti-patterns

- Do not unit-test emulator-only repository paths when integration tests are appropriate
- Do not hand-roll Firestore logic inside `jest.mock()` factories
- Do not rely on shared collection names across test files
- Do not assert implementation details of internal private methods — test public contracts
- Do not use merged LCOV or global suite % as a release gate for this library

## AI-assisted testing

Agent **rules, commands, and skills** are authored once under `.rulesync/` and generated to every
tool with [rulesync](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync) via `npm run rules:sync`. **Edit
`.rulesync/`, never the generated files.** `npm run rules:check` (`rulesync generate --check`) fails
if the generated files drift from the source, and runs in the `pre-push` hook and CI (and is part of
`release:verify`). Generated outputs are prettier-ignored (emitted verbatim). Testing rules:

- `test-awareness` — suggests tests after code changes (always-on)
- `test-guardrails` — scoped guardrails for `src/tests/**`
- `testing-docs-sync` — scoped to test infrastructure (this file, jest configs, coverage-gate
  script, husky hooks, shared mocks/factories, integration helpers)

Generated per tool: Cursor (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`), Claude Code (`.claude/rules/*.md`), and the
cross-tool `AGENTS.md` standard (root `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/memories/*.md`, read by Codex and
others). The always-on **project memory** is generated to the root `AGENTS.md` (read natively by
Cursor and Codex) and to `CLAUDE.md`, since Claude Code does **not** read `AGENTS.md`. Both are real
generated files. `CLAUDE.md` was previously a committed symlink to `AGENTS.md`, which double-loaded
every rule for Claude Code: `AGENTS.md` inlines the non-root rule bodies, and Claude Code separately
reads `.claude/rules/`. The root rule deliberately does not target Cursor — Cursor reads `AGENTS.md`
natively — so rulesync logs a benign "No root rulesync rule file found for target 'cursor'" note.

> **Target order matters.** `agentsmd` and `codexcli` both write `AGENTS.md` and the last one in
> `targets` wins, but they emit different formats: with `codexcli` last (the current setting) the
> non-root rule bodies are **inlined** into `AGENTS.md`; with `agentsmd` last, `AGENTS.md` carries
> only a reference table pointing at `.agents/memories/`. Nothing warns you — do not reorder these
> casually.

Keeping the CLI on latest, and reviewing generator-output diffs when a bump changes files, is
documented in [rulesync.md](./rulesync.md) (daily `rulesync-upgrade` workflow + Grok 4.5 review).

Skills and commands are also rulesync-managed (authored in `.rulesync/skills/*/SKILL.md` and
`.rulesync/commands/*.md`), so they propagate to every agent — Cursor (`.cursor/skills`,
`.cursor/commands`), Claude Code (`.claude/skills`, `.claude/commands`), and the AGENTS.md family
(`.agents/skills`). The former `.claude/skills` / `.claude/commands` symlinks into `.cursor/` are
gone; the repo now commits no symlinks at all. Testing-related entries:

- `skills/unit-testing/SKILL.md` — unit test patterns
- `skills/integration-testing/SKILL.md` — emulator integration patterns
- `commands/write-unit-tests.md` — diff-based unit test workflow
- `commands/write-integration-tests.md` — diff-based integration test workflow
