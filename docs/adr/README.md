# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** — short documents that capture a
significant architectural or contract-level decision, the context that forced it, and its
consequences. They explain _why_ the codebase looks the way it does, which commit messages and the
`CHANGELOG` alone don't convey.

## Conventions

- One decision per file, named `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md` with a zero-padded, monotonic number.
- Start from [`0000-template.md`](0000-template.md).
- A record is immutable once **Accepted**. To change a decision, add a _new_ ADR that supersedes the
  old one and update the old one's status to `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
- Keep records decision-focused. Link to the `CHANGELOG`, code, or design docs for exhaustive detail
  rather than duplicating it.
- **ADR-0017 deferral footers:** amendment _blockquotes_ inside ADR-0017 are **historical
  snapshots** (they keep the remaining-list wording as of that amendment, e.g. `(#32–#41)` after
  #31). Feature ADRs that close a deferral (0023 / 0024 / 0025 …) may end with a short **"remaining
  deferrals (#N–#41)" footer kept as a living index** — update that list when a later issue ships,
  and note the living-index intent inline so the rewrite is not mistaken for silent history
  revision.

## Status values

`Proposed` · `Accepted` · `Superseded by ADR-NNNN` · `Deprecated`
