# Test Awareness

After completing implementation changes in Agent mode, remind the user that tests should be written
or updated for the changed files. Suggest the appropriate skill:

- **`src/utils/**`, `ErrorParser`, `ErrorHandler`, `Validation`** → unit-testing skill
- **`FirestoreRepository`, `QueryBuilder`, `CollectionGroup`, hooks, transactions** →
  integration-testing skill

**Integration tests are the primary confidence layer** for this database library — emulator-backed
reads/writes, batching, and hooks. Unit tests cover pure logic fast; they do not replace integration
coverage for ORM core paths.

**Runner:** Jest (not Vitest). See `docs/development/testing.md` for full policy.

When suggesting tests:

- Be specific about which files need coverage and which skill to use
- Mention which **coverage gate** owns the changed paths (unit vs integration)
- Do NOT auto-write tests without user approval unless explicitly asked
- If tests already exist, mention they may need updating
- Skip the reminder for trivial doc-only or config comment changes

## Coverage gate ownership

| Changed paths | Suite | Gate command |
| ------------- | ----- | ------------ |
| `src/utils/**`, `ErrorParser`, `ErrorHandler`, `Validation`, `index.ts` | Unit | `test:coverage:gate:unit` |
| `FirestoreRepository`, `QueryBuilder`, `CollectionGroup`, emulator validation paths | Integration | `test:coverage:gate:integration` |

Merged LCOV is not used as a gate — each suite enforces its own path-specific thresholds.
