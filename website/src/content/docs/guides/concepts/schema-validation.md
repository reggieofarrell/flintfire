Validation runs automatically before every write, using a Zod schema you attach at construction.

Validation happens automatically before any write operation using Zod schemas. Attach a schema with
`FirestoreRepository.withSchema(...)` and the repository derives the write and update schemas it
enforces on `create`, `update`, and `patch`.

```typescript
const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  email: z.email(),
  age: z.number().int().positive().optional(),
});

const userRepo = FirestoreRepository.withSchema(db, 'users', userSchema);

try {
  await userRepo.create({
    name: '',
    email: 'not-an-email',
    age: -5,
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    console.log(error.issues);
    // [
    //   { path: ['name'], message: 'Too small: expected string to have >=1 characters' },
    //   { path: ['email'], message: 'Invalid email address' },
    //   { path: ['age'], message: 'Too small: expected number to be >0' }
    // ]
  }
}
```

The `message` text on each issue is produced by Zod, so the exact wording depends on your Zod
version (this package requires Zod 4) and any custom messages you pass to your schema (e.g.
`z.string().min(1, 'Name is required')`). The `path` array is what you should branch on.

## No top-level `id`

No schema you pass to `withSchema(...)` (or to a subcollection with a schema) may declare a
top-level `id` field. The repository asserts this at construction and throws if a top-level `id` is
present. Schemas describe the document's own data; the document name is the sole source of `id`,
overlaid onto every read.

## Validation behavior

- Do NOT include a top-level `id` field in schemas passed to `withSchema(...)` — it is rejected at
  construction; the id comes from the document name.
- `create()` validates against the write schema (the read schema, or the `writeSchema` overlay when
  supplied).
- `update()` validates against that write schema made `.partial()`.
- **Zod `.default(...)` values are applied on `create`, but never injected on `update`.** A partial
  update writes only the keys you actually provide — an omitted field that has a schema default is
  left untouched (its stored value is preserved, not silently reset to the default). This holds at
  every nesting level, so `update(id, { name })` never clobbers a defaulted sibling like `prefs`,
  and `update(id, { config: {} })` writes `{}` rather than re-injecting a nested `count` default.
  Defaults remain the right behavior on `create`, where every field is being written for the first
  time.
- A top-level `id` is never part of a `create`/`update`/`patch` payload — the document id comes from
  the document name (auto-generated on `create`) or the method's `id` argument (`update(id, …)`,
  `upsert(id, …)`).
- `create()` therefore does **not** require `id` in its input type — the id is auto-generated (or,
  for `upsert`, taken from the explicit `id` argument); reads always include `id`.
- This applies only to a document-level top-level `id`; nested IDs (for example `items[].id`) are
  normal domain data and are written like any other field.
- Write operations follow this sequence: `before*` hook -> validation -> Firestore write -> `after*`
  hook.
- Validation errors are thrown after `before*` hooks run and before any Firestore write occurs.
- Firestore `FieldValue` sentinels are supported in write payloads. As of v3 the default is
  `sentinelPolicy: 'strict'`: only sentinels a field's write combinator permits pass, and the parsed
  Zod output (coercions/defaults/transforms) is always returned. Declare accepted sentinels with the
  per-field combinators (see
  [Per-Field Sentinel Approval](/flintfire/guides/concepts/field-value-sentinels/)). The pre-v3
  `sentinelPolicy: 'permissive'` (any sentinel on any field; writes the raw payload when a
  sentinel-path parse fails) is available as an explicit opt-in.

## Accessing derived schemas

The repository exposes the read schema you provided plus the two schemas it derives internally for
validation.

```typescript
const userRepo = FirestoreRepository.withSchema(db, 'users', userSchema);

// Canonical read schema (no top-level id)
const readSchema = userRepo.schemas?.read;

// Internal write schemas used by repository validation
const createSchema = userRepo.schemas?.create; // the write schema (read schema, or writeSchema overlay)
const updateSchema = userRepo.schemas?.update; // create schema made partial
```

`schemas.update` is the raw `.partial()` Zod schema, so parsing a payload through it **directly**
(`schemas.update.parse(...)`) still applies Zod defaults for omitted keys. The default-stripping
described above happens in the repository's `update`/`patch` path, not in this raw schema — prefer
the repository methods for writes.

## Validating reads (opt-in)

Reads are **compile-time casts**, not runtime validation — `getById`, query terminals,
`fromSnapshot`, and the rest return the Firestore payload (plus `id` overlay / `readConverter`)
without parsing through Zod. That keeps the default path fast and predictable.

When you need a runtime guarantee at a trust boundary, compose the explicit validators:

```typescript
// Throwing — returns the parsed value (Zod transforms/coercions apply)
const user = userRepo.validate(await userRepo.getByIdOrThrow(id));

// List — all-or-nothing (first bad doc throws ValidationError)
const users = userRepo.validate(await userRepo.getAll());

// Non-throwing — filter bad docs instead of failing the whole batch
const ok = userRepo
  .safeValidate(await userRepo.getAll())
  .filter(r => r.success)
  .map(r => r.data);
```

Both methods require a schema-configured repository (`withSchema`). Data-shape failures become
`ValidationError` (same as writes). Calling them without a schema throws a plain `Error` — that is a
config mistake, not a validation failure.

### What gets validated

Both methods run against the **converted** read shape — after any `readConverter` transform and the
`id` overlay, since that is what the read methods return. Write your read schema against the
converted types: if `createMillisTimestampConverter` exposes a stored `Timestamp` as a `number`,
declare that field `z.number()`, not a Timestamp type.

The repository-owned `id` is **separated before parsing and re-attached afterward**, so the returned
value always carries it even though a read schema may never declare one — and a **strict** read
schema (`z.strictObject(...)` / `.strict()`) works, rather than rejecting `id` as an unrecognized
key.

As with all Zod object parsing (and the write paths), other keys **not** declared in the read schema
are **stripped** from the returned value. A stored document that has drifted to include fields outside
the schema comes back with those fields dropped — the return value is the parsed shape, not a copy
of the input.

To keep documents written under an older schema in the current shape on **every** read (not only
where you call `validate`), do the coercion in the `readConverter` — see
[Schema Evolution](/flintfire/guides/designing/schema-evolution/#normalizing-across-schema-changes).
With that in place, `validate` / `safeValidate` become pure assertions that pre-migration documents
still pass.

For listeners / streams, validate inside the callback (`repo.validate(doc)` /
`repo.safeValidate(docs)`). See
[Using with Firestore triggers](/flintfire/guides/integrations/cloud-functions/) for the
`fromSnapshot` + `validate` pattern.
