Inject custom logic at specific points in the data lifecycle — auditing, enrichment, validation, and
cleanup — without cluttering your business logic.

## Overview

Hooks let you observe and shape writes as they flow through the repository. Register them with
`on(event, fn)`; the callback may be synchronous or `async` (the repository awaits it). A single
event can carry multiple listeners, and they run in registration order.

```typescript
userRepo.on('afterCreate', async (user, context) => {
  // context.event === 'afterCreate'; context.execution === 'direct'
  await auditLog.record('user_created', user);
});
```

## Hook context (`HookContext`)

Every callback receives a second argument: a typed `HookContext` correlated with the
registration event.

| Field         | Meaning                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event`       | The registration event (useful for shared multi-event handlers).                                                                        |
| `execution`   | `'direct'` for normal repository/query writes; `'transaction'` only on `before*` hooks fired from `*InTransaction` helpers.             |
| `retryable`   | `false` for direct; `true` for transaction before-hooks (the Admin SDK may re-run the callback under contention).                       |
| `attempt`     | Present only on the transaction branch: a 1-based count of how many times `runInTransaction` entered the Admin SDK callback, or `null` when the caller owns a raw Admin SDK transaction. **Diagnostic only — never an idempotency key.** |

One-argument callbacks remain source-compatible (TypeScript allows fewer parameters).

### Delivery rules

- Hooks run **in registration order**, each `await`ed sequentially.
- The **first thrown/rejected hook stops later hooks** for that event (fail-fast). There is no
  best-effort or aggregate delivery.
- Transaction `before*` hooks may run **once per callback attempt** under contention. Key side
  effects by a business / write identity stored atomically with the data — not by `attempt`.
- `after*` hooks are **postcommit**, in-process, and **not durable** across process crash. Prefer
  idempotent side effects, or a durable outbox when available (tracked separately as
  [#80](https://github.com/reggieofarrell/flintfire/issues/80)).

When an outcome-sensitive failure occurs (before-hook, after-hook, partial fixed batch, or
postcommit `{ returnDoc: true }` read-back), the repository throws `WriteOutcomeError` with a
discriminated `outcome` and the original failure as `cause`. Ordinary validation / conflict /
precondition errors remain top-level when no write committed and no hook is the failed phase. See
[Error Handling](/flintfire/reference/errors/).

## Hook execution order

- `before*` hooks run first and can enrich or normalize the payload before schema validation.
- The validated payload is the one persisted to Firestore.
- `after*` hooks run only after a successful write.
- Bulk operations fire the corresponding `beforeBulk*` / `afterBulk*` events with the same ordering
  guarantees.

Because `before*` runs before validation, it is the correct place to fill in defaults, coerce
values, or reject a write early. See
[CRUD operations](/flintfire/guides/working-with-data/crud-operations/) for the write methods
these hooks wrap.

## Available hooks

- **Single operations**: `beforeCreate`, `afterCreate`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate`,
  `beforeDelete`, `afterDelete`
- **Bulk operations**: `beforeBulkCreate`, `afterBulkCreate`, `beforeBulkUpdate`, `afterBulkUpdate`,
  `beforeBulkDelete`, `afterBulkDelete`

### `upsert` dispatches on existence

`upsert(id, data)` does an existence pre-read and then takes one of two branches, so **which hooks
fire depends on whether the document already exists**:

| Document at `id` | Hooks fired                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| does not exist   | `beforeCreate` → `afterCreate`   |
| already exists   | `beforeUpdate` → `afterUpdate`   |

If a rule must hold for every `upsert`, register it on **both** pairs — or use `createWithId` (always
create-only) when you want a single, predictable branch.

### Operations that run **no** hooks

Three write paths deliberately fire nothing:

- **`bulkWrite`** — high-throughput, non-atomic BulkWriter path. If any bulk hook is registered on
  the repository, the call **throws** unless you pass `{ skipHooks: true }` to acknowledge that those
  hooks will not fire.
- **`recursiveDelete`** — deletes a document and every descendant; no per-document or bulk delete
  hooks run (the SDK streams name-only snapshots and descendants live in collections this repository
  may not model).
- **`recursiveDeleteCollection`** — deletes every document in this repository's collection and every
  descendant; the same name-only / cross-collection reasons apply, so no delete hooks can honestly
  supply modeled payloads.

Do not assume every write goes through the hook table above.

## Hook payloads

| Event                                  | Payload                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `beforeCreate`                         | The create payload (before validation), plus a **readonly `id`** when the caller supplied one (`createWithId`, `upsert`). Absent for auto-id `create()`, so the field is optional. |
| `afterCreate`                          | The parsed write output (`z.output<writeSchema>`, coercions/defaults applied) plus the generated `id` |
| `beforeUpdate`                         | The update payload plus the target `id` (`data & { id }`)                                             |
| `afterUpdate`                          | `{ id }`                                                                                              |
| `beforeDelete` / `afterDelete`         | The full persisted document (`FirestoreDocument<T>`)                                                  |
| `beforeBulkCreate`                     | An array of create payloads (before validation), each with a **readonly `id`** — ids are generated before the hook runs, so they are always present here |
| `afterBulkCreate`                      | An array of parsed write outputs (`z.output<writeSchema>`), each plus its generated `id`              |
| `beforeBulkUpdate`                     | `{ id, data }[]`                                                                                      |
| `afterBulkUpdate`                      | `{ ids: ID[] }`                                                                                       |
| `beforeBulkDelete` / `afterBulkDelete` | `{ ids: ID[]; documents: FirestoreDocument<T>[] }`                                                    |

Delete hooks (single and bulk) receive the full persisted document(s) as they existed before
deletion, so cleanup logic has access to every field, not just the `id`.

### Hook payload immutability

Hook payloads protect identity and accounting:

- **Identity is read-only.** The `id` / `ids` on a payload cannot be repointed by a hook, and the
  event envelopes and bulk arrays are frozen — a hook cannot reorder, splice, or replace entries to
  redirect or suppress a write.
- **Before-update hooks may mutate data _in place_** (`entry.data.someField = …`) but may not
  replace the whole `data` object.
- **Delete payloads are observe-only and deep-frozen**, so a `beforeDelete`/`beforeBulkDelete` hook
  cannot forge nested data that a later `afterDelete`/`afterBulkDelete` hook (or an audit/outbox
  consumer) then observes. **Limitation:** a class-instance field value returned by a
  `readConverter` (e.g. a mutable `Date`, `Map`, or custom class) is not cloned or frozen — treat
  such values as observe-only by convention.

## Examples

```typescript
// Log all user creations
userRepo.on('afterCreate', async user => {
  console.log(`User created: ${user.id}`);
  await auditLog.record('user_created', user);
});

// Send welcome email
userRepo.on('afterCreate', async user => {
  await sendWelcomeEmail(user.email);
});

// Validate business rules before update
orderRepo.on('beforeUpdate', data => {
  if (data.status === 'shipped' && !data.trackingNumber) {
    throw new Error('Tracking number required for shipped orders');
  }
});

// Enrich create payload before validation (e.g., timestamps/defaults)
orderRepo.on('beforeCreate', data => {
  data.createdAt = new Date().toISOString();
  data.updatedAt = new Date().toISOString();
});

// Clean up related data after deletion
userRepo.on('afterDelete', async user => {
  await orderRepo.query().where('userId', '==', user.id).delete();
});
```

In the last example, `query().delete()` is a query-level bulk write: it runs
`beforeBulkDelete` / `afterBulkDelete` on the target repository, but does **not** run the
per-document `beforeDelete` / `afterDelete` hooks — which is exactly what you want here, since it
avoids re-triggering per-document cleanup logic recursively.

## Query-level writes run the bulk hooks

`query().update(data)` runs `beforeBulkUpdate` and `afterBulkUpdate`; `query().delete()` runs
`beforeBulkDelete` and `afterBulkDelete`. `beforeBulkUpdate` may mutate the update payload before it
is validated and written, `afterBulkUpdate` receives `{ ids }` for the written documents, and the
bulk-delete hooks receive `{ ids, documents }`. The per-document `before/afterUpdate` and
`before/afterDelete` hooks do **not** run on query-level writes — use the single-document methods
when you need those. Separately, `bulkWrite`, `recursiveDelete`, and `recursiveDeleteCollection` run
**no** hooks at all (see
[above](#operations-that-run-no-hooks)). See
[Queries](/flintfire/guides/working-with-data/queries/).

## When hooks do not run

Hooks are wired into the per-document and bulk methods on the repository. One path differs from that
standard flow:

- **Transactions — `before*` only.** Inside `runInTransaction((tx, repo) => { ... })`, the
  transaction-scoped `repo`'s write helpers (`createInTransaction`, `updateInTransaction`,
  `patchInTransaction`, `deleteInTransaction`) **do** run their `before*` hooks (before validation
  and the staged write). Their `after*` hooks do **not** run — the transaction has not committed
  while the callback executes, so post-commit side effects belong after `runInTransaction` resolves.
  See [Transactions](/flintfire/guides/working-with-data/transactions/).
