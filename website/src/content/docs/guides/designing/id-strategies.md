  'Choose between auto-generated, deterministic, and shared document ids — and how to write each

The Firestore document name is your document's identity (see
[Document Identity](/flintfire/guides/concepts/document-identity/)). Choosing how that name is
assigned is a modeling decision. This page covers the three common strategies and how to write each.

## Auto-generated ids (the default)

Let Firestore assign a random id. Use `create(data)` — it generates the id and returns `{ id }` (or
the document with `{ returnDoc: true }`). This is the right default for entities with no natural key
(users created by sign-up, orders, events):

```typescript
const { id } = await orderRepo.create({ total: 42, status: 'pending' });
```

If you need the id **before** writing — e.g. to reference it from another document in the same
request — mint one with `repo.newId()` and write under it with `upsert`:

```typescript
const orderId = orderRepo.newId();
await invoiceRepo.upsert(invoiceId, { orderId }); // reference it first
await orderRepo.upsert(orderId, { total: 42, status: 'pending' });
```

## Deterministic / static ids

When a document has a natural key — a slug, an external system's id, a singleton config document —
use that value as the id. Choose the write method by what a re-run should do:

- **`createWithId(id, data)`** — create-only. Claims the id exactly once; a second write (or a
  concurrent claim) raises `ConflictError` and leaves the stored document untouched. Use this when
  the id must be **claimed** (an idempotency key, an upstream record id, an email hash).
- **`upsert(id, data)`** — create-or-overwrite. Re-running is idempotent and overwrites. Use this
  when the latest write should win (a singleton config, a mirrored external record).

```typescript
import { ConflictError } from 'flintfire';

// Claim an externally-derived id exactly once
try {
  await productRepo.createWithId(`sku-${sku}`, { name, price });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ConflictError) {
    // Already claimed — do not overwrite.
  }
}

// A singleton config document at a fixed id (re-runs overwrite)
await configRepo.upsert('app-config', { featureFlags: { darkMode: true } });

// A record keyed by an external id where the latest snapshot should win
await productRepo.upsert(`sku-${sku}`, { name, price });
```

Validate any externally-sourced id at the boundary with `repo.id(rawKey)` before using it as a
document name — see [Document Identity](/flintfire/guides/concepts/document-identity/). For the
full create-only / precondition surface, see
[Conditional writes](/flintfire/guides/working-with-data/crud-operations/#conditional-writes).

## Shared ids across collections

To model a 1:1 relationship, store two documents under the **same id** in different collections (a
`users/{uid}` profile and a `userSettings/{uid}` document). Reads become direct `getById(uid)`
lookups on either collection — no query, no join. Write the secondary document with `upsert(uid, …)`
so it lands at the shared id.

## Choosing

| Strategy       | Write method          | Use when                                                |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto-generated | `create(data)`        | No natural key; the common case                         |
| Claim once     | `createWithId(id, …)` | A natural key that must not be overwritten on collision |
| Deterministic  | `upsert(id, data)`    | A natural key / slug / external id; re-runs overwrite   |
| Singleton      | `upsert(id, data)`    | Exactly one document (config, counters)                 |
| Shared (1:1)   | `upsert(id, data)`    | A parallel document keyed by another collection's id    |
