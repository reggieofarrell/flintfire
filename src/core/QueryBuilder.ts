  /**
   * Run multiple aliased aggregations in a **single** Firestore aggregate request — the dashboard
   * case: count + total + average (or any mix) without three round trips.
   *
   * Spec shape is a plain descriptor object (not a callback factory): each key is the result alias,
   * each value is `{ kind: 'count' }` or `{ kind: 'sum' | 'average', field }`. Field paths keep the
   * same {@link NumericFieldPaths} typing as {@link sum} / {@link average}. Result aliases map to
   * `number` for `count`/`sum` and `number | null` for `average` (ADR-0020 null fidelity). A
   * runtime-built (widened) spec degrades safely to `number | null` per alias.
   *
   * **Sparse-field intersection (emulator-observed; production UNVERIFIED):** when the spec
   * includes a `sum`/`average` over a field that only some matching documents carry, the document
   * set for the **entire** request collapses to documents that have that field — so a sibling
   * `count` can return less than `count()` alone. Prefer aggregating required schema fields; when
   * you need an unconditioned count alongside a sparse-field sum, issue `count()` as a separate
   * call. See ADR-0027.
   *
   * Other semantics:
   * - Backend max is **5** aggregations per request (not capped locally — the server message is
   *   actionable if Google raises the limit).
   * - Non-numeric values are skipped by `sum`/`average` but still counted by `count`, so
   *   `average !== sum / count` when non-numerics are present.
   * - `sum` of int64 values beyond 2^53 loses JavaScript number precision.
   * - `where` / `orderBy` / `limit` / `limitToLast` / cursors / `offset` all apply; `orderBy(field)`
   *   itself excludes documents missing that field.
   * - Aggregation queries need the same indexes the underlying query needs.
   * - `select()` + a count-only spec is legal; `select()` + any `sum`/`average` is rejected locally.
   * - The alias `'__proto__'` is rejected before any SDK call (SDK alias-map crash).
   * - Unknown / missing `kind` values are rejected locally (runtime-built specs via `JSON.parse`
   *   are the sanctioned untyped path — silently treating them as `average` would be wrong).
   *
   * @param spec - Alias → aggregation descriptor map (at least one entry; max 5 enforced by backend)
   * @returns An object whose own keys are the spec aliases and whose values match each kind's type
   *
   * @example
   * const stats = await orderRepo
   *   .query()
   *   .where('status', '==', 'completed')
   *   .aggregate({
   *     orders: { kind: 'count' },
   *     revenue: { kind: 'sum', field: 'total' },
   *     avgOrder: { kind: 'average', field: 'total' },
   *   });
   * // stats.orders: number; stats.revenue: number; stats.avgOrder: number | null

  /**
   * Add a **composite** filter — nested `AND` / `OR` boolean expressions, which chained `where()`
   * calls (an implicit top-level AND) cannot express.
   *
   * The callback receives a schema-aware {@link QueryFilterFactory}: `f.where(...)` takes the same
   * typed stored field paths as {@link where} at every nesting depth, and `f.whereId(...)` applies
   * the same validated document-id boundary as {@link whereId}. A prebuilt Admin SDK `Filter` may be
   * returned directly (`f => myFilter`) as an escape hatch — it is applied verbatim, without the
   * typed-path or id validation the factory provides.
   *
   * Composes with everything else on the builder: a `whereFilter()` is AND-ed with any chained
   * `where()` clauses, and works with `orderBy`/`limit`, `select`, the aggregations, pagination,
   * `stream()`, `onSnapshot()`, the `update()`/`delete()` terminals, and vector prefilters.
   *
   * ⚠️ **An inequality inside an `or()` branch drops documents that are MISSING that field — even
   * documents matched by a DIFFERENT branch.** Firestore adds an implicit `orderBy` for every
   * inequality field (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`) collected across the *flattened* filter tree, and a
   * document without an ordered field cannot appear. (`not-in` is an inequality too, but it can never
   * appear inside an `OR` — Firestore rejects that combination outright.) So an OR query can return
   * **fewer** rows than one of its own disjuncts, and `count()` agrees — it is not a read-path artifact:
   *
   * ```
   * where('kind', '==', 'x')                              → 4 docs
   * whereFilter(f => f.or(f.where('score', '>', 5),
   *                       f.where('kind', '==', 'x')))    → 3 docs  ← a `kind: 'x'` doc has no `score`
   * ```
   *
   * This also affects the destructive `update()` / `delete()` terminals, which would silently skip
   * those documents. Safe shapes inside `or()`: equality, `in`, and `array-contains` /
   * `array-contains-any`; and `f.whereId(...)` with a comparison operator, which is exempt because
   * Firestore skips `documentId()` when adding implicit orders and a document name always exists.
   * If you need an inequality branch, ensure the field is always written (e.g. a default at create
   * time), or run the branches as separate queries and merge by `id`.
   *
   * Firestore enforces its own limits on the **server** and the ORM does not duplicate them (a local
   * copy would risk rejecting a query the backend accepts, and the counts multiply across clauses the
   * callback cannot see). Non-exhaustively: at most 30 disjunctions after normalization (an ANDed pair
   * of 6-value `in` filters is already 36), `in` accepts at most 30 values, at most one
   * `array-contains` **per disjunction**, and one `!=` / `not-in` **per query** — which also counts
   * `!= null` / `!= NaN`. A `not-in` anywhere in the query is incompatible with any `OR`, including a
   * `not-in` from a chained `where()` outside this callback. All surface as `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. A
   * composite query may also require a composite index.
