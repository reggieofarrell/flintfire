/**
 * Firestore-aware semantic deduplication of read field values (issue #40).
 *
 * `QueryBuilder.distinctValues()` is a **client-side** terminal: it downloads the matching documents
 * and dedupes `doc.data()[field]` in process. A JavaScript `Set` dedupes objects by *reference
 * identity*, so two structurally identical maps — or two `Timestamp`s naming the same instant read
 * from two documents — were reported as separate values. Firestore's own value equality is
 * structural (maps are unordered key/value sets; references compare by path), so identity dedupe
 * contradicted the method's documented contract for every non-scalar type.
 *
 * The fix canonicalizes each value into a **JSON-serializable, type-tagged tree** and dedupes on
 * `JSON.stringify` of that tree, keeping the first value seen for each key. Type tags keep values of
 * different Firestore types apart (`'1'` never keys the same as `1`, `NaN` never as `null`), and
 * letting `JSON.stringify` do the quoting is what makes the encoding injection-proof: a hand-rolled
 * delimiter join silently merges `['a', 'b']` with `['a,s:b']`.
 *
 * **Never over-merge.** Two values collapse only when the canonical form proves them equal. Anything
 * unrecognized — a `Map`, a `Set`, a custom class a `readConverter` returned — falls back to
 * per-instance identity, which is exactly the old behavior. That direction is safe (a distinct value
 * survives as distinct); the other direction silently drops results from a caller's list. Every
 * Firestore value class has a prototype other than `Object.prototype`, so a failed nominal check
 * lands in the identity fallback rather than in the plain-object branch.

/**
 * Depth ceiling for the canonicalization walk. Firestore itself caps map nesting at 20 levels, but
 * `doc.data()` returns `readConverter` output, which is arbitrary caller code — so the walk needs its
 * own bound. Hitting it emits a terminal marker instead of recursing, which can only ever *merge*
 * values that agree down to this depth. Together with the path-scoped cycle `seen` set, that bounds
 * *recursion depth* so cyclic or over-deep input cannot overflow the stack.
 *
 * It does **not** bound memory. The canonical form is fully expanded, so converter output that
 * reuses one shared subtree under many keys (an acyclic shared-subtree DAG) can still exhaust heap —
 * the path-scoped `seen` set correctly treats that sharing as a DAG, not a cycle, and `MAX_DEPTH`
 * never fires on a shallow graph. Stored Firestore data cannot trigger this (`doc.data()` builds
 * fresh unshared objects per map, and nesting is capped at 20); only memoized `readConverter` graphs
 * can. Memoizing `canonicalize` on a per-pass `WeakMap` would make the walk linear in distinct
 * nodes — that is a follow-up, not this change (see #77).
